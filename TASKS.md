## Priority Notes

1. Core Assessment Engine tasks should be completed first as they form the foundation
2. Assessment Logic tasks depend on the Core Engine being functional
3. UI/UX improvements can be worked on in parallel with Assessment Logic
4. Quality and Performance tasks should be ongoing throughout development

## Getting Started

To begin implementation, we should start with:

1. AI provider integration
2. Queue system implementation
3. Basic text processing

This will give us the core functionality needed to begin processing assessments.
